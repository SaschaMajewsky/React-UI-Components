Q:
What is ReactJS and what problems does it try to solve?

A:
React is a UI Library for JS which received a big popularity because of the integration and invention through Facebook.
It resolves with the help of heavily usage of components
and states the problem of technically expensive DOM operations
for websites. Doing a lot of DOM Operations usually lead to a 
very slow loading website that was needed to be refreshed
often. With the help of the virtual DON React can create a kind 
of diff of the changed elements of a websites and can load 
back into it only the elements that have changed. Also ReactJS
is because of the usage of components quite reusable, functional 
and not opinionated in the way the Javascript is written and 
how it is applied. Less opionated libraries offer more freedom
and possibilities, but also lead to more complexity.
